# Common FRP

Common functional reactive programming utilities.

## Goals

- [ ] Classical FRP with behaviors and events (also called cells and streams, or signals and streams)
- [ ] 1st order FRP, static graph
- [ ] Graph description can be serialized to JSON
- [ ] Glitch free: updates happen during discrete moments using a transaction system
- [ ] Cycles

## Todo

- [ ] Transactions
- [ ] Transformations should happen during same transaction
- [ ] Cell to stream happens one transaction later
