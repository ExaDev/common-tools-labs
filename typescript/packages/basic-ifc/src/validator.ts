/**
 * This module contains the validator, which is responsible for checking the
 * integrity and confidentiality constraints of a recipe.
 *
 * The validator works by generating constraints from the recipe and then
 * unifying them to find a solution. The constraints are generated from the
 * recipe by:
 *
 *  - Adding constraints from the outside (e.g. input constraints)
 *  - Adding constraints from the modules used in the recipe
 *  - Adding constraints from the graph in the recipe, according to information
 *    flow control principles
 *
 *
 * Expanding on the last point: For each node, we generate constraints on all
 * the inputs and its output. Constraints on the outputs are constraints flowing
 * downstream, e.g. anchored by upstream modules or recipe inputs. Input
 * constraints are flowing upstream, and come from downstream modules or
 * constraints on the recipe outputs:
 *
 *  - Output integrity: The integrity is `ModuleOutput<ModulePrincipal,
 *    inputs>`, where inputs corresponds to the integrity of the inputs, so set
 *    to the variable representing them.
 *
 *  - Output confidentiality: The confidentiality is the join of all the input
 *    confidentiality variables.
 *
 *  - Input integrity: The integrity of each input must be higher or equal (>=)
 *    than the corresponding `inputs` parameter of the module output. TBD
 *    substitution rules. I think we have to generate constraints for each input
 *    here, somehow cleaving off the trust the module provides at each step.
 *
 *    There are two cases: Something on the way endorses the required integrity,
 *    then we don't want to propagate that requirement further. To problem is
 *    that we don't know that until we've propagated to that step. So possibly
 *    we need to keep creating new variables on each step to captures the
 *    possible transformation to "integrity >= BOTTOM".
 *
 *    The other case is that the integrity is passed through, so here we keep
 *    the upstream requirement, but we also require the trust in the module.
 *
 *    Ok, so we're going to keep creating new variables per input and capture a
 *    substitution rule that resolves the above two cases once enough
 *    information is available.
 *
 *  - Input confidentiality: The confidentiality of the input must be at most
 *    (<=) any constraint on the output confidentiality.
 *
 *    It may pay to first simplify the join of guardrails then! Essentially,
 *    only flow allowed by all guardrails is allowed. So we can pick any
 *    guardrail and then for each term of its meet check if it's allowed by all
 *    the other ones (as in: at least one of the other's terms allows it), and
 *    only keep those. Or more precisely, join each of these terms and keep the
 *    result if it isn't TOP, and if one of the guardrails only merges to TOP,
 *    then no flow is allowed. Note that for declassifier terms (themselves join
 *    expressions), we'll always get results, but some of them have no chance of
 *    ever being allowed, for example because they require integrity that is
 *    mutually exclusive â€“ we don't yet have means to identify these, but we
 *    might need that to cut down on the number of terms we have to keep. But
 *    also, a declassifier to a flow principal that is now already required can
 *    be dropped.
 *
 *    Now we have one guardrail <= another guardrail, which is true if no term
 *    on the left allows flow that isn't allowed by at least one term on the
 *    right. Or in other words, we can we use x <= y iff x = x meet y, which
 *    here means any term on the right can be absorbed by terms on the left.
 *
 *
 *  Next we need to model declassification, which is removing confidentiality
 *  terms that appear as integrity. TODO: Spell out
 *
 *  Next we consider restrictions on the flow provided by module manifests. Note
 *  that these don't require trust, they are voluntary restrictions on the flow,
 *  usually so that their output can be trusted by others, or to get the ability
 *  to use a sensitive capability (which restricts what data it would ever see).
 *  TODO: Spell out
